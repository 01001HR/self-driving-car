# self-driving-car

In this repository I will share the **source code** of all the projects of **[Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013)**.

Hope this might be useful to someone! :-)

## Table of Contents

#### [P1 - Detecting Lane Lines (basic)](project_1_lane_finding_basic)
 - **Summary:** Detected highway lane lines on a video stream. Used OpencV image analysis techniques to identify lines, including Hough Transforms and Canny edge detection.
 - **Keywords:** Computer Vision
 
#### [P2 - Traffic Sign Classification](project_2_traffic_sign_classifier)
 - **Summary:** Built and trained a deep neural network to classify traffic signs, using TensorFlow. Experimented with different network architectures. Performed image pre-processing and validation to guard against overfitting.
 - **Keywords:** Deep Learning, TensorFlow, Computer Vision
 
#### [P3 - Behavioral Cloning](project_3_behavioral_cloning)
 - **Summary:** Built and trained a convolutional neural network for end-to-end driving in a simulator, using TensorFlow and Keras. Used optimization techniques such as regularization and dropout to generalize the network for driving on multiple tracks.
 - **Keywords:** Deep Learning, Keras, Convolutional Neural Networks
